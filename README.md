# STM32 Bus Drivers

The purpose of the "STM32 Bus Drivers" project is to:
* Provide a drop-in replacement for the Adafruit Bus IO class library that uses STM32 HAL and LL drivers.
* Provide advanced features available on the STM32 processors into an Adafruit-compatible class library, such as DMA.
* Provide a library that isn't dependent on Arduino and will allow better portability of Arduino-based libraries into generic STM32 projects.

Portions of this code are based on Adafruit libraries and sample code from ST Microelectronics. We buy a lot of STM and Adafruit parts and use their code and tools daily, and we encourage you to shop at:
* https://www.adafruit.com/
* https://www.digikey.com/
* https://www.mouser.com/
* https://estore.st.com/en/

.. and other fine resources.
